Requires Velyn's DAT <-> JSON tool for full functionality.
I have provided my JSON files of my DATs. These are not 1:1 retail, use at your own risk, they are just for reference.

Not fully compatible with LSB/ASB. Use at your own risk.
A fully functional LSB version will be created at a later date.

Usable, but might not work perfectly:
Mods / Pet Mods / Latents - Different enums than what LSB uses for numerous mods.

Unusable:
Item_Usable.sql - LSB does not have msg or param columns.
Item_Basic.sql - I do not have support for Variables of the "aH" column LSB uses
